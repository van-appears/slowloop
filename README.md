# slowloop

Can you recreate 'I Am Sitting In A Room' by Alvin Lucier using the inbuilt microphone and speakers of a laptop?
No, not really, the quality of those devices leads to terrible screech as the higher frequencies survive each iteration.

This small application attempts to get round that problem by _slowing_ the playback of what has been recorded, to reduce the higher frequencies.
